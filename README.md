#### NOTE
***It's important to note that this project, due to its size and scope, was developed without the use of RxJS. In the case of this application, there was no need to utilize RxJS as the responsiveness is more than satisfactory, although it doesn't imply that it isn't the best approach. Similarly, not much emphasis was placed on the design of the application itself. This web application was created specifically to meet the criteria of the task within a very short period. Angular 17, Node.js v21 and .NET 5 were used in the development process.***
